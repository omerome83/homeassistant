# Home Assistant Configuration

## Overview

Our smart home is powered by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and features over 60 automations and 10+ scripts that we use regularly. It's been an absolute delight to turn our dream of living in a smart home into a reality with this application.

As we continue to make improvements to our home, I will be updating our configuration files regularly.
