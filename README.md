# Home Assistant Configuration

## Overview

My [Home Assistant](www.home-assistant.io) configuration with currently 70 (and counting) automations and 10+ scripts. These are active automations and sensor data which are used everyday.

With the help of this application, the dream of living in a smart home has been a pleasurable experience. This configuration will get updated frequently so make sure to ‚≠ê my configuration to stay up-to-date. I hope this can be an inspiration to anyone who also wants to take the dive into home automation.
